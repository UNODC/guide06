    <h3>2. Legal Considerations for Seizing Digital Evidence</h3>

    <p>Prior to seizing any digital evidence ensure that you have a legal basis for doing so. Seizing evidence without
        authority may render it inadmissible in court and may get you in trouble.</p>

    <p>In some countries,it is a requirement of travelers at international airports, ports or immigration checkpoints
        to provide the login details of any electronic devices in their possession. Failure to do so may constitute an
        offence and/or result in a refusal for travelers to enter the country. You should research the specific laws or
        regulations of your country to determine what your powers are, (if any) to seize and examine digital media
        devices such as mobile telephone, tablets and computers at international points of entry.</p>

    <p>Before you seize any device that may contain digital evidence ask yourself:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do I suspect that the owner of the device is engaged in criminal activity?</li>
        <li>What is the basis of my suspicion?</li>
        <li>Do I have a legal right to seize the device?</li>
        <li>Do I have a legal right to examine the device?</li>
        <li>Are there restrictions on the information I can examine on the device?</li>
        <li>Are there restrictions on how long I can keep the device?</li>
        <li>Do I have the authority to demand that the owner of the device provides me with access to it, including PIN
            numbers and passwords?</li>
        <li>Do I need to seek permission from a Senior Officer to seize and examine the device?</li>
        <li><img class="rightFloat200" src="../imgs/G09_02_02.svg" />Do I have access to facilities or equipment to undertake a forensic examination of the
            device?</li>
        <li>Do I have the facilities available to securely transport and store the device?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Remember</strong>, you may be responsible for returning a seized device to the owner should it not
        contain any evidence of criminal activity. Make sure that you have obtained enough details from them to enable
        you to return the device at a later stage.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Actions taken to secure and collect digital evidence should not affect the integrity of that evidence.</li>
        <li>Persons conducting an examination of digital evidence should be trained for that purpose.</li>
        <li>Actions taken during the seizure, examination, storage and transfer of digital evidence should be
            documented, preserved and available for review at a later stage.</li>
    </ol>
