    <h3>3. The Value of Digital Evidence</h3>

    <p>The emergence of the personal computer and the mobile telephone has had a profound impact on the law enforcement
        and the collection and presentation of evidence. It has also forced the introduction of new procedures and
        rules of evidence in relation to the presentation of this type of evidence in Courts. You should keep yourself
        up to date with the rules and procedures that govern your jurisdiction.</p>

    <p>Digital evidence can link criminals to people, places and events. Telephone records, photographs, audio and
        video recordings, social media accounts, geotags and even search history can all be important pieces of
        evidence in proving a criminal case.</p>

    <p>There are many different types of crimes where digital evidence may be relevant. These include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Murder</li>
        <li>Terrorism</li>
        <li>Drug Trafficking</li>
        <li>Precursor Trafficking</li>
        <li>Human Trafficking</li>
        <li>Migrant Smuggling</li>
        <li>Wildlife Crime</li>
        <li>Sex Crimes</li>
        <li>Fraud</li>
        <li>Chemical Waste</li>
        <li>Money Laundering</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are just a few examples and there are many more but remember, to extract the maximum value from digital
        evidence it will require that <em><strong>you</strong></em>, the front-line officer, adhere to your Departments
        policies and procedures in relation to the collection, analysis and storage of digital evidence to ensure its
        admissibility in Court.</p>
