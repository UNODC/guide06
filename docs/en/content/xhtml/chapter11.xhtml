    <h3>11. Transporting and Storing Digital Evidence</h3>

    <p>Digital media devices are fragile and sensitive; you must treat them with care while transporting them or
        storing them.</p>

    <p>You should always avoid exposing digital media devices to the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Extreme temperatures.</li>
        <li>Moisture.</li>
        <li>Physical Damage.</li>
        <li>Magnetic Fields.</li>
        <li>Static Electricity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Transporting Digital Evidence</h6>

    <p>You should ensure that all digital evidence is properly documented and labelled and that any power chords or
        adapters are marked with the corresponding digital device. Ensure that any chain of custody documents have been
        completed.</p>

    <p>Ensure that digital evidence is not left in vehicles for protracted periods of time and never leave your vehicle
        unattended whilst transporting digital evidence.</p>

    <p>When transporting digital evidence in a vehicle you should place it in the rear away from magnetic sources such
        as your radio and speakers.</p>

    <p><strong>Storing Digital Evidence</strong></p>

    <p>Store all digital media devices in antistatic packaging such as paper bags and envelopes, cardboard boxes and
        anti-static containers. Do not use plastic bags as they can produce static electricity and allow moisture to
        develop, which may damage or destroy the evidence contained on the device.</p>

                <td style="vertical-align:middle">
                    Ensure that the digital evidence is stored in a secure, climate-controlled environment that is not
                    exposed to
                    extreme temperature of humidity. Access to this room should be limited and any entry recorded.
