<h2><strong>14. External Storage Devices</strong></h2>

<p>There are many different types of external storage devices that you may encounter as a frontline law enforcement officer. Some of these devices may be the size of your hand and others may be very small. Each of these devices may potentially contain digital evidence and if seized will need to be analysed.</p>

<p><strong>Different types of storage devices include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Portable Hard Drives.</li>
	<li>USB Flash Drives.</li>
	<li>CD Discs.</li>
	<li>Blue-Ray Discs.</li>
	<li>Floppy Discs.</li>
	<li>Secure Digital (SD) Cards.</li>
	<li>Micro SD Cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware when you are searching people, premises or vehicles that these devices can be very small and are easily concealed. Some of these devices may be encrypted, <em><strong>if you find an encrypted device it is important to ask the suspect for the </strong></em><em><strong>password</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
